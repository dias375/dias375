I am a versatile professional with years of experience in development for the Financial, Banking and Payments industry. In my projects, I specialize in building microservices using Java, Spring Boot, and SQL as the main stack. Additionally, I have expertise in various other tools and frameworks like Git, Gradle, Maven, JUnit, Mockito, and Jenkins.

In addition to my skills in Java, I also have experience working with Javascript and Python. I have had the opportunity to work in companies that implemented Agile and SCRUM methodologies with CI/CD, Clean Code, and SOLID principles as requirements.

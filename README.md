## ðŸ‘‹ aboutMe
A versatile professional with years of combined experience as a Back-end Developer for Financial Institutions and as an Automation and Mechanical Engineering Professor for Universities.

Most of my projects in software development involve Rest APIs using Java, Spring Boot and SQL as main stack, combined with a multitude of other tools and frameworks such as Git, Gradle, Maven, JUnit, Mockito and Jenkins.

I also have experience working with Python for automation solutions and in companies that implemented Agile and SCRUM methodologies with CI/CD, Clean Code and SOLID as requirements.
